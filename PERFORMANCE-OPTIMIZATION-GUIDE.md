# MELAVERSE Performance Optimization Guide

This guide outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the MELAVERSE website to ensure fast loading times and smooth scrolling experiences.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization

We've created an `OptimizedImage` component (`components/optimized-image.tsx`) that enhances the Next.js Image component with:

- Lazy loading using Intersection Observer
- Blur-up loading effect for better perceived performance
- Proper image sizing and quality optimization
- Fallback handling for failed image loads

**Implementation:**

Replace standard Image components with OptimizedImage:

```jsx
// Before
<Image
  src="/images/example.jpg"
  alt="Example"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

// After
<OptimizedImage
  src="/images/example.jpg"
  alt="Example"
  width={600}
  height={400}
  lowQualityPlaceholder={true}
/>
```

### 2. Animation Performance

We've added utilities in `lib/performance-optimizations.ts` to improve animation performance:

- `useIntersectionObserver`: Only animate elements when they're visible
- `useThrottle`: Prevent excessive function calls during animations
- `usePrefersReducedMotion`: Respect user preferences for reduced motion

**Implementation for ScrollAnimation component:**

Update the ScrollAnimation component to use these optimizations:

```jsx
// In scroll-animation.tsx
import { usePrefersReducedMotion } from "@/lib/performance-optimizations";

// Inside the component
const prefersReducedMotion = usePrefersReducedMotion();

// Adjust animations based on user preference
const animationVariants = prefersReducedMotion
  ? {
      hidden: {},
      visible: {},
    }
  : variants[variant];
```

### 3. Heavy Component Optimization

For heavy components like `background-beams.tsx` and `globe.tsx`, we've implemented:

- Deferred loading until after critical content is rendered
- Reduced animation complexity for mobile devices
- Throttled animation frame updates

**Implementation for Globe component:**

```jsx
// In globe.tsx
import {
  usePageLoadComplete,
  useThrottle,
} from "@/lib/performance-optimizations";

// Inside the component
const isPageLoaded = usePageLoadComplete();

// Only render the globe after page load
if (!isPageLoaded) {
  return <div className="h-full w-full bg-black/20" />; // Placeholder
}
```

### 4. CSS and Layout Optimization

- Reduced layout shifts with proper sizing
- Minimized CSS complexity
- Used hardware-accelerated properties for animations

**Implementation:**

```css
/* Use transform instead of top/left for animations */
.animated-element {
  transform: translateY(10px); /* Better than top: 10px */
  will-change: transform; /* Hint for browser optimization */
}

/* Add containment where possible */
.contained-section {
  contain: content; /* Isolates this section from the rest of the page */
}
```

### 5. JavaScript Optimization

- Deferred non-critical JavaScript
- Throttled event handlers for scroll events
- Implemented proper cleanup for event listeners

**Implementation example for scroll handlers:**

```jsx
// Before
window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);

// After
import { useThrottle } from "@/lib/performance-optimizations";

const throttledHandleScroll = useThrottle(handleScroll, 100);
window.addEventListener("scroll", throttledHandleScroll);
```

## Deployment Recommendations

1. Enable Next.js Image Optimization in production
2. Use a CDN for static assets
3. Implement proper caching headers
4. Consider using a performance monitoring tool

## Measuring Performance

Use these tools to measure the impact of optimizations:

- Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
- WebPageTest.org
- Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console

## Next Steps

1. Implement code splitting for large components
2. Consider server-side rendering for critical content
3. Optimize third-party scripts loading
4. Implement resource hints (preconnect, prefetch)

By implementing these optimizations, MELAVERSE will provide a fast, smooth experience for all users, regardless of their device or network conditions.
